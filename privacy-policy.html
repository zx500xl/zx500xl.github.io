We also give you some basic examples:</span></p><p><b>LEGAL BASIS</b></p><p><b>Legitimate interest</b></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purpose of processing: Responding to your requests.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: We may process your name and/or email, e.g., to properly respond to your unsubscribe request.</span></li></ul><p><b>Contract</b></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purpose of processing: Processing transactions and sending you related information, including confirmations and reminders for account management and other administrative purposes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: We may send you a reminder (e.g., via push notifications) if your subscription has expired or is due to expire, or we may email you containing your invoice, if applicable, using your device data.</span></li></ul><p><b>Consent</b></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purpose of processing: Making offerings to you.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: We may offer you a discount for our subscriptions.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the processing of physical data and special categories of personal data, including sensitive information like health data, explicit consent from the user serves as the legal basis. This consent is essential for enabling users to utilize the Platforms provided by us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Platforms offer the option to make purchases directly within the application (including subscriptions) or directly through the Site. If you choose to make a purchase within the application, you may use third-party payment systems and/or providers. We do not collect or process any information related to your payment instruments, such as your bank card number or its validity term, under any circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when you make purchases directly through our Site, including subscriptions, you authorize an applicable payment system and/or provider to collect this payment information. We do not collect or process your payment data (such as credit card number, expiration date, etc.) for purchases made through our Platforms. We strongly recommend reviewing the Privacy Policy of the payment system you use for making payments, such as the privacy policy of Stripe: </span><a href="https://stripe.com/en-pl/privacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://stripe.com/en-pl/privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><h3><b>DATA RETENTION</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not retain or store personal data. Once the App is deactivated or deleted, no personal data is stored in our system. Any data provided during App usage is not retained for further processing or storage purposes.</span></p><h3><b>SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may need to share your personal data with certain third parties as follows:</span></p><p><b>Third-party service providers:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may include providers of certain systems and services that we use to host, administer, and maintain our Platforms, including the servers used to host our Platforms, email service providers, payment processors, fraud prevention vendors, analytics, customer service providers and other service providers.</span></p><p><b>Third-party service providers for marketing purposes:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you consent to any marketing from us, certain personal data may be shared with third-party service providers we use to help us carry out marketing including, e.g., third-party marketing automation platforms.</span></p><p><b>Compliance with Laws:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; or</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) to protect the security or integrity of the Platforms; or</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) to protect us, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities; or</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">d) to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</span></li></ol><p><b>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties that do not directly identify you.</span></p><p><b>Group companies:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal data may be shared among affiliates and subsidiaries.

We will do our best to keep this personal data secure. All information we hold is stored on our secure servers (which we own or license from appropriate third parties). We use industry-standard procedures and security standards to prevent unauthorized access to our servers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there may arise situations where we need to collaborate with trusted third parties located outside the EU to deliver services and subscriptions to you (for instance, when utilizing servers in the US). We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. We adhere to the principles of minimization and anonymization, where feasible, to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data privacy laws when transferring personal data, if necessary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing your personal data, you explicitly consent to its transfer, storage, or processing outside the EU. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that this information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p><h3><b>DATA WE USE BUT DO NOT COLLECT</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time we may use certain data for the purposes of the App’s operation. However, the following data is not collected by us:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Photos and Videos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: App scans photo library to identify duplicate, similar, or large files for the purpose of cleaning up a device. However, we do not store or collect photos or videos; all analysis happens locally on the device.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Storage Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The App accesses the total storage capacity and current usage on the device to provide insights and optimize storage, but this data is not collected or shared outside of the device.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Metadata</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: App may temporarily access metadata (e.g., file sizes, dates) associated with photos and videos. This metadata is not collected or stored by the Platforms.</span></li></ul><h3><b>SECURITY</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring the security of your data is a top priority for us. We employ robust technical and organizational measures to safeguard the personal information entrusted to us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have instituted reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. For instance:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We utilize SSL encryption (HTTPS) for all interactions involving personal data.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our databases are encrypted, and we store data on physically secure servers protected by firewalls.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of a personal data breach as defined in Article 4.12 of the GDPR, we will promptly notify you. This notification will include relevant details, measures taken, and an assessment of associated risks, as required by applicable law and our Privacy Policy. We are committed to addressing breaches promptly and transparently, taking necessary actions such as logging affected users out, initiating password resets, and other appropriate measures to mitigate the breach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To report a personal data breach or seek assistance, please contact us via </span><a href="mailto:support@oneclickcleaner.pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@oneclickcleaner.pro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aim to ensure that you are fully informed about all your data protection rights and the methods available to exercise them. Please note that these rights may vary depending on your location:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access: you can request to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rectification: if you believe that any personal data, we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement it.

Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have then to provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your personal data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all Platforms.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to File Complaint: you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal data with the supervisory authority of your country.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To exercise your rights, please contact us via </span><a href="mailto:support@oneclickcleaner.pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@oneclickcleaner.pro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or to us at the address set forth in the “Contact” section.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you submit a request, we typically aim to fulfill it within one month. If additional time is needed to assist you in exercising your rights, we will inform you accordingly. We reserve the right to reject manifestly unfounded or excessive requests.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process of exercising your data protection rights, we may ask you to confirm your identity. This verification step ensures that you are entitled to access certain information and that the rights of third parties are not infringed upon. If we are unable to verify your request, we will be unable to fulfill it.</span></p><h3><b>OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the EU, you must meet the age requirement specified by the laws of your country to use our services, e.g. if you are at least 16 years old in Germany, you are eligible to provide explicit consent for the processing of your data. Alternatively, if you are under the required age, you can still use our services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal data from children, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a parent and learn that your child is using our Platforms without your permission, or if you have a specific question about data privacy, do not hesitate to get in touch with us via </span><a href="mailto:support@oneclickcleaner.pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@oneclickcleaner.pro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the United States, you must be at least 13 years old to use the Platforms. If we become aware that information has been collected from children under the age of 13 in the United States in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its regulations, we will not disclose this data. We reserve the right to promptly delete the account (if applicable) and erase all associated information, including health and sensitive data, from our servers.</span></p><h3><b>HOW CAN YOU MANAGE YOUR DATA?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to access, correct, or update your personal data, you can do so at any time by contacting us via </span><a href="mailto:support@oneclickcleaner.pro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@oneclickcleaner.pro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and describing your request in a few words.</span></p><h3><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and data use practices, the features of our Platforms, or advances in technology.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please check this page periodically for changes and refer to the “last updated” date at the top of the page to know if it has been revised since your last visit. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that we consider to be material to your consent, we will notify you of them.</span></p><h3><b>PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS, US</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t sell your personal info to others for money, and we’re not in the business of trading data. But like many online companies, we team up with other parties to handle our ads on different platforms. Sometimes, we may share some basic personal info with them for targeted ads. This might be seen as “selling“ or “sharing“ under the CCPA.
